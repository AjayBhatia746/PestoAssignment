## Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of a microservices-based system for managing a simple e-commerce application. The system handles user authentication, product management, and order processing. The services are designed with a focus on concurrency control, clustering for high availability, and best practices in backend engineering.

## Microservices Architecture
The system is divided into the following microservices:
- **Authentication Service:** Manages user authentication and authorization.
- **Product Management Service:** Handles product CRUD operations and implements concurrency control.
- **Order Management Service:** Manages order processing and ensures users can only access their own orders.

## Concurrency Control
### Product Management Service
Concurrency control is implemented using [choose a suitable method, e.g., optimistic locking]. This ensures that multiple users can safely read and update product information without conflicts.

## Clustering and High Availability
The microservices are deployed in a clustered environment for high availability. [Specify the clustering mechanism used, e.g., Kubernetes]. The system can handle failures gracefully, ensuring continuous availability even if one node/container goes down.

## Database Integration
The system utilizes [choose a database, e.g., MySQL] for storing user information, product data, and order history. The database schema is designed to efficiently store and retrieve relevant entities.

## APIs and Communication
RESTful APIs are implemented for each microservice, allowing them to communicate with each other. Endpoints include user registration, product CRUD, and order management. Microservices can make synchronous or asynchronous calls to other microservices as needed.

## Authentication and Authorization
User authentication and authorization mechanisms are implemented to secure access to protected endpoints. Users can only access their own orders and the products they are authorized to view/update.

## General Requirements
- Code Quality: The code is clean, well-documented, and follows best practices for the chosen programming language and framework.
- Version Control: Git is used for version control, and the repository is available [provide repository link].
- Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling and logging are implemented for each microservice.
- Testing: Unit tests cover critical components, including concurrency control mechanisms.
- Deployment: Clear instructions for deploying and running the microservices on a local development environment or a cloud platform are provided.

## Bonus Features (Optional)
- API rate limiting to prevent abuse.
- Message queues for asynchronous communication between microservices.
- Caching strategies to improve system performance.
- Monitoring and alerting solutions (e.g., Prometheus and Grafana).

## Submission
Provide the link to your version-controlled repository [GitHub, GitLab].
Include clear instructions on setting up and running the microservices.
